# Cineflex

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

Cineflex is a single-page application that simulates a Ticketmaster-like website. The movie, session, and seats data comes from the API provided by Responde Ai. The user can select any number of seats at any particular session for any particular movie and enter their name and CPF for each selected seat to "purchase a ticket". I've put that in quotes because there is no checkout implementation in the project and the API will accept any submission as long as it fits the expected data structure.
